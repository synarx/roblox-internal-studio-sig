Unpatched Signature: ``0x48, 0x81, 0xEC, 0x40, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x84, 0xD2, 0x74, 0x05, 0xE8``

Patched Signature: ``0x48, 0x81, 0xEC, 0x40, 0x03, 0x00, 0x00, 0x84, 0xD2, 0x90, 0x90, 0xE8``

Replacing the unpatched signature with the patched signature will give the internal version of Roblox Studio.
You can use [this](https://github.com/7ap/internal-studio-patcher) to do that. (If the signature is out of date, and these ones arent, you can edit the source code to use these signatures.)

I will try update these signatures when I can.
